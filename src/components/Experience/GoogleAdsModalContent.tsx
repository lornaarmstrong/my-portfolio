        <p className="experience-description">
          I completed a 12-week internship with a team in the Ads section of
          Google. This was part of the Student Training in Engineering Program
          (STEP), run by Google for students in their first or second year of
          university.
        </p>
        <p className="experience-description">
          Due to COVID-19 restrictions, this internship was changed to a remote
          position and the project was adjusted. I worked with another intern to
          design and develop a web application to combat increased loneliness in
          university student communities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, deployed
          through Google Cloud Platform. I also presented the project, alongside
          my colleague, to the London Ads organistaion.
