# Lorna Armstrong - Portfolio

This repo holds the code for my professional portfolio - currently being worked on.

## Aim

The aim of this project is to design a website that can be used as my portfolio and also as a chance to strengthen my design and programming skills.
It should provide:

- An introduction to me and my interests as a Software Engineer.
- Detailed information about relevant projects.
- An outline of my professional experience.

I am also keen to apply knowledge of accessible design and human computer interaction and to challenge myself to improve further in my skillset.

## Wireframes and Design

For wireframing, I have used sketches drawn by hand which I then translated to more detailed designs using Figma.

## Code and Implementation

To create this portfolio, I am using React and TypeScript.
